Second team project for the SZFM course. The project seeks to mimic a real life scenario in which we use the **Scrum** framework by working in a team to create an application
and apply agile methodology throughout the process.

The _**Trello**_ table for the project can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/TdSsUmOR/szfmprojektvol2)
